Welcome to my first GitHub repository! This project focuses on creating a landing page using HTML and CSS. Building a landing page is an excellent starting point for beginners in web development. Through this project, you will gain a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, learning how to structure web pages, style them, and create visually appealing layouts.

Project Overview
A landing page is a standalone web page, created specifically for marketing or advertising campaigns. It's where a visitor "lands" after clicking on a link from an email, ad, or other digital location. The goal of a landing page is to guide the visitor towards a single action, such as making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or downloading a resource.
